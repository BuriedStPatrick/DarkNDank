# DarkNDank
A Visual Studio 2019 theme aimed at replicating ReSharper colors.

## Notes
This is probably not the optimal way to carry over font colors from ReSharper, but it's what I've come up with so far. I'm currently in the process of transitioning away from ReSharper and I'm finding I miss the specific 
colors it 
provides.
Keep in mind I might be missing some stuff occasionally, I'm only human and notice things as I go along. If you find any colors missing, feel free to create an issue and I'll take a look at it.

## Installation
* Install Visual Studio Color Theme Editor 2019
* Import this theme
